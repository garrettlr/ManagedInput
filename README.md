### Managed Input

Effectively a clone of [react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) V1. 

Originally Written about a year ago as part of a personal exercise. It's somewhat sloppy, because it's not production code and wasn't intended to be seen by anybody else.

### Running
```
yarn
yarn start
```

Will be available on `localhost:3000`.
